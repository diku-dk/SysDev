Suggestion solution to Exercise 5_2:

Task:
```
Write a main method that exhibits the correct functioning of the Employee class (create new employees, 
retrieve data from the employees, modify attributes of an employee, etc).```
```


The main method can be found in `main.py`
It shows the use of the constructor and the use of some getters and setters from the Employee class (including `get_age()`)
